Measuring blood pressure is a standard procedure during any medical visit and it plays a critical role in monitoring your overall health. High blood pressure can lead to severe health issues including heart disease and stroke.

Here is how to measure blood pressure using a home monitor:

1. Sit down and rest for at least five minutes before taking the measurement.

2. Make sure your arm is relaxed and at heart level.

3. Place the cuff on your arm, ensuring it fits snug but not too tight. The lower edge of the cuff should be about an inch above the bend in your elbow.

4. Follow your monitor's instructions to start the test.

5. Note the top number (systolic) and the bottom number (diastolic) on the digital readout.

The normal range for blood pressure is generally under 120/80 mmHg. Regular checks can help you and your healthcare provider keep a close eye on your health and take preventive measures when necessary.
